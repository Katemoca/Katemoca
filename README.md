## Who am I?
I am a **full-stack developer** with a focus on **frontend** and **visual material design**, with experience in **backend and databases**.

I have a degree in modern languages and am interested in educational and technological innovation. I am a student at Soy Henry and a passionate lover of programming, music, and communication. 

## What do I do?
Currently, I dedicate myself to constant practice through simple and large-scale projects to improve my problem-solving skills and solidify my knowledge. I love discovering all the possibilities of **creation through code**. 

## Where am I heading?
My main goal is to generate projects that benefit people in their daily lives through code.  

Due to the high demand in this field, my path as a programmer is focused on continuous improvement in problem-solving and the creation of projects that impact society.

## What technologies do I use?
To take off ðŸš€ and become the programmer I've always dreamed of ðŸ˜Š, I intensively practiced the following technologies at the Henry bootcamp: 

**Javascript** -
**Node.js** -
**React.js** -
**Express.js** -
**PostgresSQL** -
**Sequelize** -
**GIT** -
**HTML** -
**CSS** 

## My projects
At Henry, I constantly practiced creating a Single Page Application (SPA) using these technologies comprehensively. Feel free to check out the repository ðŸŽ® PI-VIDEOJUEGOS-videogames.

"I also contributed to the development of a full-stack application for a private hospital. As a team, we utilized various technologies for both the back-end and the front-end, in addition to other libraries. Personally, I enhanced my knowledge in Figma, React.js, Redux, and JavaScript. I also learned how to implement libraries such as Inext18, Leaflet and Tailwind CSS, and gained proficiency in managing React context."

## You can find me here
